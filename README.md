## üêç Python-BookStore GUI

- Fifth example course from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Uses Tkinter library to build a fullstack application with a GUI, including button/list widgets and a sqlite3 database
- Users can use the full CRUD operations by entering the text in the labelled fields and clicking the actions
- Includes executable file that users can copy and run WITHOUT Python installed, will create a DB for you if one is missing


## üìì Comments

- First time creating a UI for an app that was not web/browser based. It was simpler than expected but the ultimate output feels very dated/ has poor UX. Unsure if this is a limitation of Tkinter or just the intentional simple nature of the project
- Wrapper functions in this project function almost identically to controllers, and feels weird defining them on the front end, but seems to be convention for the Tkinter library


## üíª Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory, and then use ``` python frontend.py  ``` to run the application
- The window will popup on your screen, letting you interact with the app, it will handle the DB creation for you
- If you do NOT have Python installed you can simply use the executable within the dist directory, click/ run this file and it will run a windowed version for you
